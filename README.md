# Fetal-Health-Classifier
A GUI was built around the application of some basic machine learning models. 
At first, a cross validation was performed between Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest.
The "Random Forest Classifier" turned out to be the most suitable one.
The interface created is quite basic,and was done just to get a hold of the deployment procedure.
